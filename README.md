# SpaceInvaders Hackathon Project

During my boot-camp course in October, we were requested to create a project within 24-hours.

I have a great interest in video-games, and thought it would be fun to create a small space invader game with the help of a tutorial on youtube.

## Installation

This can be run on visual code studio with your localhost, if you have the plugin Live Server.
